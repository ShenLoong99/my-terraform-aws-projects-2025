KUALA LUMPUR: The ringgit climbed to another five-year new high against the US dollar in early Wednesday trade, supported by a weaker greenback as the US dollar index (DXY) weakened.

At 8 am, the local currency surged to 4.0490/0710 against the greenback from 4.0615/0665 at yesterday’s close. The ringgit hit 4.0490/0530 on March 3, 2021.

Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the DXY fell 0.39 per cent to 97.903 points after the Conference Board reported that US consumer confidence dropped to 89.1 points in December from 92.9 points in November, below the consensus estimate of 91.7 points.

He said the local note had closed 0.39 per cent higher against the US dollar at 4.06 yesterday.

"As such, the ringgit could maintain its positive momentum, supported by the latest US economic data,” he told Bernama.

At the opening, the ringgit was traded higher against a basket of major currencies.
